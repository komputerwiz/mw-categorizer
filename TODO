Performance Enhancement

   ☐ Caching!!!
   ✔ Is there a faster way to find the top categories without sorting? @done (13-12-02 22:07)
       Using extension of \SplHeap in BMN\Bundle\WikiCategorizer\FrontendBundle\Collection\CategoryConfidenceMaxHeap and \LimitIterator is much faster than using usort() and array_slice()
   ✔ isset vs. array_key_exists @done (13-12-02 16:52)
       issset is definitely the fastest way to do this, but there's a caveat: if $arr[$key] === NULL, then isset($arr[$key]) will return false. This does not apply to us, but for future reference, the correct way to do this is to use isset($arr[$key]) || array_key_exists($key, $arr): http://www.zomeoff.com/php-fast-way-to-determine-a-key-elements-existance-in-an-array/
